### Amused: A Muse S Direct Protocol Implementation

Finally, the breakthrough the neuroscience and BCI community has been waiting for! Amused is the **first publicly available** reverse-engineered implementation of the Muse S Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. 

Here's the kicker: **We actually got access to InteraXon's official SDK, but it doesn't provide what researchers really need.** The SDK restricts you to their high-level abstractions, doesn't expose raw sensor access, and locks you into their ecosystem. Even with SDK access, you can't:
- Access the raw BLE protocol
- Modify streaming parameters
- Build custom integrations
- Have full control over your data

So we did what had to be done - reverse-engineered the entire BLE protocol from scratch. After countless hours of packet sniffing and analysis, we discovered the critical detail: The `dc001` streaming command must be sent TWICE. This undocumented requirement stumped everyone who tried before.

### What Makes This Special

🎯 **First of Its Kind**: Nobody else has published a working Muse S protocol implementation  
🔓 **Truly Open**: MIT licensed, no proprietary dependencies  
🧪 **Research Ready**: Direct access to raw sensor data for your experiments  
💡 **Community Driven**: Built by researchers, for researchers  
⚡ **Beyond the SDK**: More control than even the official SDK provides  

### Complete Sensor Access

- **EEG Brain Waves**: 4-5 channels at 256 Hz native sampling
- **PPG Heart Rate**: 3-wavelength photoplethysmography (IR, NIR, Red)  
- **fNIRS Blood Oxygenation**: Real-time cerebral hemodynamics (HbO2, HbR, TSI)
- **IMU Motion**: 9-axis accelerometer and gyroscope
- **Sleep Monitoring**: 8+ hour continuous recording sessions

### Perfect For

- **Neuroscience Research**: Direct access to EEG without SDK limitations
- **BCI Development**: Build brain-computer interfaces with full control
- **Sleep Studies**: Complete biometric monitoring through the night
- **Meditation Apps**: Real-time brain state feedback
- **Biohacking**: Track your cognitive performance and optimization
- **Education**: Learn BLE protocols and biosignal processing

### Why "Amused"?

It's a playful acronym for "**A Muse S Direct**" connection - and yes, we're quite amused that we finally solved what nobody else could! This represents months of packet sniffing, protocol analysis, and careful reverse engineering.

### Technical Highlights

- Pure Python with Bleak BLE library
- No compilation or native dependencies
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Async/await modern architecture
- CSV data export for analysis
- Real-time processing pipelines

### Get Started in 30 Seconds

```python
pip install amused

import amused
client = amused.MuseSleepClient()  # Full sensors
await client.connect_and_monitor()  # Start streaming!
```

### SDK vs Amused - The Difference

| Feature | Official SDK | Amused |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Raw BLE protocol access | ❌ | ✅ |
| Custom streaming modes | ❌ | ✅ |
| Direct sensor control | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modify packet structure | ❌ | ✅ |
| No licensing restrictions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Works without Muse app | ❌ | ✅ |
| Source code available | ❌ | ✅ |
| Community contributions | ❌ | ✅ |

### Community Impact

For years, researchers and developers have been forced to use InteraXon's closed SDK, limiting what they could build and research. Even those who got SDK access (like us) found it insufficient for real research needs. With Amused, you have complete freedom to:
- Modify the protocol
- Access raw unfiltered data
- Build commercial applications
- Integrate with any platform
- Contribute improvements

This is more than just code - it's freedom for the Muse community.
